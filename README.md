# Introduction
It is a meme maker web application which is made with vanilla js in the frontend . I used [moveable](https://daybrush.com/moveable/) library to implement drag rotate and warp feature and also use express in the backend for easy routing though it is very little. Pug for view engine . I also used an [imgflip](https://imgflip.com/api) api which is fetched by axios to generate 100s of meme template.

# Features
- It has 100 meme templates
- It has a simple meme editor
    - the editor can create new text
    - it can increase the font size and change color
    - it can delete all the text
- Finally it can save the meme image as jpeg format in your device file system
